# Optimized-Data-Routing-UWSN

This project simulates energy-efficient, cluster-based data routing in a 3D underwater wireless sensor network using Python. It uses K-Means clustering and multi-hop transmission to evaluate energy consumption and network performance.

## ðŸ’¡ Features
- Random deployment of sensor nodes in a 3D space
- Clustering with K-Means
- Multi-hop routing to nearest cluster heads
- Energy monitoring of each node
- Calculation of throughput and average energy usage

## ðŸ“Š Output
- 3D plot of nodes and cluster heads
- Metrics: data sent, throughput, energy consumption
